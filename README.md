# xNormal_App
Distributed version of the xNormal library. (v3.19.3)

# About

xNormal is a FREE application to generate normal / ambient occlusion / displacement maps. It can also project the texture of the highpoly model into the lowpoly mesh ( complete texture transfer, even with different topologies ). It includes too an interactive 3D viewer ( with advanced shaders and realtime soft shadows / glow effect ), some Photoshop filters and importers/exporters for 3dsmax and Maya. It supports high levels of parallelism using multicore/multithreading, distributed/parallel rendering, ray tracing and advanced GPGPU techniques

Unfortunately, it is relatively more difficult to find a safe downloadable copy of the SDK as the website no longer exists. This repo serves to be a faux-mirror of the SDK for anyone to use. It includes the standalone installer along with everything that would be found from installing the application.

This repository does not provide any support or questions about the use of the program. It is merely here to serve a download mirror.
